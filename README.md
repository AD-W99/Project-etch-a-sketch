# Project-etch-a-sketch
The goal of this project is to create something akin to an etch-a-sketch which can be played with on the browser. A grid of divs generated by JavaScript will represent the sketchpad that the user can draw on like an etch-a-sketch by hovering their mouse over the divs. The user will also be able to adjust the number of divs in the grid between 1x1 and 100x100 as well as choose what kind of color they want to use on the sketchpad. The point of this project is to showcase my ability with DOM manipulation.
